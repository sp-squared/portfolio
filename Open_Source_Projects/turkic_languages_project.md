# Turkic Languages Audio-to-Text Transcription

**Winter 2025**

## Overview

An open-source Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) pipeline for Bashkir, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz languages with deterministic orthography correction.

## Key Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Processes audio in three Turkic languages (Bashkir, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz)
- **Deterministic Orthography Correction**: Uses rule-based methods for reliable and reproducible transcription
- **Open Source**: Fully accessible and transparent implementation
- **ASR Pipeline**: Complete end-to-end speech recognition system

## Technical Approach

This project addresses the challenge that Bashkir is unsupported by major ASR systems by:
- Leveraging Whisper ASR technology
- Processing through Kazakh language models
- Applying deterministic rule-based corrections to convert output to proper Bashkir orthography
- Ensuring reproducibility through non-stochastic methods

## Languages Supported

- **Bashkir** (ba) - Primary focus
- **Kazakh** (kk) - Processing intermediary
- **Kyrgyz** (ky) - Additional support

## Project Goals

- Provide accessible speech recognition tools for underserved Turkic languages
- Maintain transparency and reproducibility through deterministic methods
- Support open science principles in language technology
- Enable accurate transcription for linguistic research and practical applications
